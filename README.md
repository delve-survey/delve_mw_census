# DELVE Milky Way Satellite Selection Function and Empirical Model

This GitHub repository contains the products associated with the observational selection function and empirical model from the *DELVE Milky Way Census I* paper. We include simple, ready-to-use examples in two Jupyter notebooks.  To run the code locally, please use the provided Conda environment file. Python 3.10 or later is required.

We are still refining the Selection Function and expect to have a release version available once the paper is published. If you plan to use these products or have any questions, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to Chin Yi Tan (chinyi@uchicago.edu) or Alex Drlica-Wagner (kadrlica@fnal.gov).
